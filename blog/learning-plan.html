        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>

        <p>My long term goal is to be working somewhere in the tech industry, ideally based in kaupapa-Māori. My background is in graphic design and I think a good career direction is in visual communication with a interactive digital approach. Taking it a step further would be creating applications that would be useful, something that I can see myself using and exploring different creative outputs.</p>

        <h5>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning. 
        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>

      <p>Some of my strengths in relation to learning would be my interest in knowledge and my endless search for answers to various topics and seeing all sides of the spectrum. I'm a keen observer and like to work in collaborative projects and see how each of our individual skills can work together within a group.</p>
      <p>My limitations towards learning and the skills I would like to develop on would be attention and focusing. Learning how to get in the most productive learning and working state. I also would like to develop more communication skills within social settings.</p>

     

        <h5>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:</h5>

        <p>I want to be able to work well and fairly with others whenever we have one on one or group tasks. I want to be able to communicate well with facilitators or any industry/community representatives I may interact with. </p>

        <p>I will communicate when I am feeling overwhelmed or not taking in information any further. I'll seek help with my facilitators and hope they can manage taking me through some steps I may get stuck on.</p>
        
       <p>I'll refer back to some of the learning competencies during the course and continue to develop on them in order to be more productive in the way I work and learn.</p>
