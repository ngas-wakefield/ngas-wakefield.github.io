        <h5>Updates to learning plan</h5>
        <h5>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h5>
        <p> It is the same as my original statement. I just want to be able to work on collaborative projects that line up well with my values, strengths and skills. It doesn't necessarily have to transfer into a career as it is also a hobby. Being able to merge both a career and a hobby is the most ideal pathway. </p>
        <h5>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? </h5>
        <p> I think my strengths have adapted in the technical side of it, I'm learning new solutions to problems and how I can make use of some of the methods. My limitations are still the same with communication, having to do bootcamp online now is going to make me try harder. </p>
        <h5>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h5>
        <p>It will be the online aspect of it and not being face-to-face learning. This is going to be the biggest challenge for me. Managing the workload while maintaning a stable lifestyle.</p>
        <h5>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
        <ul>
           <li>Working well in a group setting </li> 
           <li>Being able to communicating well with my team and teachers</li>
           <li>Able to take a fair share of workload in collaborative projects and finish them</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h5>
        <p>Just to be able to have instructions easy to follow, maintaing a good pace and clear communication. Able to have one-on-one time if I get stuck behind with something.</p>
        <h5>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h5>
        <p>My expectations are to keep gaining more knowledge about different methods of programming and keep developing my skills as a developer. Learning how to push myself in managing workloads and meeting deadlines at a good pace. Working well under pressure. Enjoying the hard work!</p>
