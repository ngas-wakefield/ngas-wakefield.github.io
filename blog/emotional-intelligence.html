       <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>

       <ul>
         <li>Self-awareness</li>
         <li>Social awareness</li>
         <li>Relationship management</li>
         <li>Self-regulation</li>
         <li>Empathy</li>
         <li>Motivation</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive and recognize different emotional inputs and outputs within yourself and within others. A great example of emotional intelligence would be Manaakitanga, extending love, compassion and hospitality to others whether it's family, work mates or strangers. Supporting each other in lifting up eachothers mana.   </p>
       
       <h4>How is it different from IQ?</h4>
       IQ is different in how it is measured based on intellectual and cognitive abilities. Having high IQ generally means someone with high functioning thought, reasoning and analytical processes. Being smart and intelligent is great and these people solve alot of problems in our modern world. The need for people with high emotional intelligence is also important in reflecting a well rounded human experience that is capable of encompassing everyone.

        <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
        <p>Being self-aware of your own emotions and how they can affect others is important in being able to relate to others and form meaningful connections and relationships (whanaungatanga). These skills are helpful in creating successful and productive work environments, maintaining a good social presence and being able to communicate well. Emotional intelligence is being able to recognize how all of these areas in life overlap and work with each other.</p>
