        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

        


        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>Some code can look very intimidating and confusing at first, I'm finding myself using pseudocode more by breaking down code to understand how each part is working. Writing pseudocode is helpful when laying out the tasks you want to do before figuring out how you will code it and to be able to go back a reflect on how you have solved something.</p>

       <h4>Console.log( )</h4>
       <p>Console logging is a good way check and display how some of your code is reading. You can console log for testing and debugging and print out messages for errors. I've been using console logging alot to use as an output to display if my code is working and experimenting with different methods. </p>

       <h4>Trying something</h4>
       <p>Diving straight in with what you already know and just trying anything is something you can do. Finding other similar methods people have used to solve a problem and then modifying it to the task you want to achieve can also work sometimes. You can use alot of code from what has already been solved.</p>


       
       <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
       <p>Error messages can look pretty scary and red but they are so helpful to pick up on something you missed because of basic human error like a mistype or missing a curly bracket. You can locate which line the problem is and will have a description of what the error is which can be a simple fix or solved by googling the error message. </p>
       
       <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
       <p>If you are really stuck and have tried everything you can think of and are basically losing your mind. Talk to an object and explain the problem. Sounds silly but could actually help you to look objectively at the problem and see it in a different perspective.</p>

       <h4>Googling</h4>
       <p>The most quickest way to solving a problem is by simply googling it. If you have a problem you most likely can solve it by googling it and finding that answer from someone who has already solved it. How you ask questions to google is also important in getting the right type of results and needs to be very specific to the language you are working in.</p>
       <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
       <p>Getting help from your peers is a good way to get an easy to understand explaination of something. They may have solved the same problem or are looking for answers as well, it is a good way to work together on solving something.</p>
      <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
      <p>Reflecting on how you solved a problem is a good way to process and learn from it. This is helpful so you can remember how you came to the solution for future problems. </p>
