<h3>A situation where I had an ethical decision to make</h3>

<p> I make an ethical decision every time I choose to buy food from the supermarkets. I'm aware of every step of the food chain from its environmental factors of producing the food to its treatment of animals. I highly value organic food, sustainability and animal welfare but I know it's not that easy to live that lifestyle in todays economy where we depend on supermarket chains to feed ourselves. We make the decision to choose between cheap and unethical than more pricey and organic. Learning to grow your own food, buying locally and from organic and regenerative farms is just some of the steps I've taken in making more ethical decisions around food.</p>


<h3>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h3>

<p>"Ehara taku toa, he takitahi, he toa takitini"</p>
    <p>My success should not be bestowed onto me alone, as it was not individual success but success of a collective</p> 

Being Maori has heavily influenced my values and identity. I believe there is more value in a fair collective system where everyones individual skills and strengths are built upon within a community than striving for individual success.

<h3>Identifying my strengths</h3>

<h3>An experience where I had to work productively with others</h3>


<p>An experience I have that changed me and opened my eyes was when I spent the last year in raglan living in a small maori community, learning to live off the land sustainably and living collectively. </p>

<p>We were a group of 20-30 year olds that were granted an opportunity to be part of an experiement of living on the land while making a living. We got to set our own curriculum and working standards through the exploration of Ako, which is the experience of to teach and learn through experience, intergenerational learning and shared collective values. I find it very fitting that I'm now here at dev academy reflecting on my values again.</p>

I feel as if my values and identity constantly change over time as I experience and learn more, like a tight tug and pull of a balanced life and total anarchy. A core thing that drives me is that I don't believe we live in a fair and justice system for everyone. I want to see progressive change in the current system, more decentralization and the right to self determination. I feel there is a universal essence that can be tapped into to achieve some sort of balance between nature and technology.
