        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        
      
<p>Modern neuroscience has come to find out now that the brain can still change as you get older and that you can continue to create more pathways in the brain to support more learning.</p>
           <h4>The brain has three functions of neuroplasticity for learning:</h4>
           <ul>
             <li>Chemical</li>
             <li>Structural</li>
             <li>Behavioural</li>
           </ul>
           <p>
           When learning a new skill or trying something new the brain is sending
           all these chemicals between neurons that is triggering responses and trying to create new pathways. The brain is rapidly increasing the amount or the concentrations of these chemicals to support learning and is the main process of short-term memory learning. </p>
           
           <p>Even though you felt like you are learning so much at the time, when you go back to the skill after a few days it can feel tricky to get back into and feel like you have lost some of the information. During learning the brain is changing the physical structure of the brain and with the long-term takes more time. Therefore making it a behavioural practice everyday can create these pathways for the long-term memory. </p>
          
           <p></p>
          </p>

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>Psychologists have had observations and theories that some people have certain mindsets when it comes to different ways of learning or tackling new challenges. </p>
          
          <p>There is two types of mindsets one can be in when it comes to learning:</p>
          <li>Growth</li>
          <li>Fixed</li>
          <p>It all depends on the perspective the person has when it comes to facing a tough challenge or facing something brand new and outside of your comfort zone.</p>
            
            <p>Do you feel worried or nervous, feel like you can't do it and will try different ways to get around it than solving it? This would be a fixed mindset.</p>

          <p>Do you accept the challenge and see it as a learning experience and try hard even if you don't succeed at it yet? This is a growth mindset. 
            </p>
            <h4>My perspective:</h4>
            <p>I personally think the growth mindset can be learned and adapted and that the fixed mindset isn't truly fixed, it's just a perspective. I have definitely spent my time going back and forth from the growth and fixed mindset. My take on it is once you start enjoying what you're learning and finding passion in it, it promotes that growth. 
              
              <p>It can be hard to stay in a growth mindset when all you're trying to do is solve all these tasks and not get in the full perspective of how and why you are learning it. It can get robotic unless you fully embrace the process of learning. 
              
              As long as you keep taking yourself through the process it all ties in with the neuroplasticity, if you keep practicing and being mindful and keep a good perspective. You can only get better at it and you will learn.</p>
